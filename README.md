# Restaurant Data Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing restaurant data stored in CSV format. By using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, we clean, process, and analyze the data to extract valuable insights that can help understand restaurant performance and customer preferences.

## Project Overview
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Data Transformation**: Structuring data for efficient analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examining data patterns and relationships between variables.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating informative and interactive visualizations to present insights.

This project is designed to practice data wrangling and visualization techniques, ideal for those interested in data science applications in the hospitality and food industry.

## Dataset Details
The dataset contains various fields related to restaurant operations, including:
- **Restaurant ID**: Unique identifier for each restaurant
- **Restaurant Name**: Name of the restaurant
- **Location**: Geographical area of the restaurant
- **Average Cost**: Typical cost for two people at the restaurant
- **Cuisines**: Types of cuisine served
- **Ratings**: Customer ratings and reviews
- **Number of Reviews**: Count of customer reviews

**Note**: The data used in this project is simulated for educational purposes.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, filtering, and grouping operations.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For static data visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive charts (optional, if interactive visualization is included).


## Analysis and Insights
### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
   - Normalizing and transforming fields such as "Cuisines" for consistent analysis.
   - Detecting and treating outliers in fields like "Average Cost" and "Ratings".

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzing customer ratings distribution across different locations.
   - Examining relationships between average cost and ratings.
   - Identifying popular cuisines in specific areas.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
   - **Ratings Distribution**: A histogram or bar plot showing the frequency of various rating levels.
   - **Cost Analysis**: Box plots or scatter plots to show average costs by restaurant type or location.
   - **Cuisine Popularity**: Pie charts or bar graphs highlighting the most popular cuisines by area.
   - **Location-Based Trends**: Maps (if applicable) to showcase geographic distribution of restaurants.

## Key Insights and Findings
Through the analysis, this project can reveal insights such as:
- **Customer Preferences**: Identifying popular cuisines and restaurant types by location.
- **Price vs. Rating Correlation**: Understanding whether higher average costs correlate with higher ratings.
- **Geographical Trends**: Spotting high-rating locations and areas with competitive pricing.
